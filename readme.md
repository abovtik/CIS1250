## Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you need to [create one](https://github.com/join).

## Create a new Private Repository

If needed, you can reference the instructions in the quickstart guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository). **Important:** use a random repository name so that other students can't view your website. It is your responsibility to keep your work private to help prevent plagiarism!

## Create an index.html File

If needed, you can reference the instructions in the quickstart guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#commit-your-first-change). You can use the contents of the [index.html](index.html) file in this repository to get started.

[learnxinyminutes.com](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/html/) provides a highly succinct introduction to HTML syntax.

## Enable GitHub Pages

1. Navigate to your repository.
2. Click the "Settings" tab.
3. Click "Pages" in the sidebar on the left.
4. Ensure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch". This is the default setting.
5. Select "main" from the Branch dropdown menu.
6. Ensure the dropdown menu to the right of "main" is set to "/ (root)". This is the default setting.
7. Click "Save".

Every time you edit index.html and commit the changes, the deployment flow will run. This flow will probably take less than a minute. Once the deployment flow has finished running for the first time, you will be able to view index.html as a website hosted at https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]. For example, this repository is hosted at https://foxcroftjn.github.io/CIS1250-template.

## Share the Repository with your Teaching Assistant (TA)

The TA will provide the username or email address associated with their account during your first lab. If needed, you can reference the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository).

## Activate GitHub Pro (optional)

GitHub Pro is free for students. You can activate this offer [here](https://education.github.com/benefits/offers). There are lots of additional resources available as part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). You (probably) won't need any of this for this course, but it is still worth looking at them so that you know what is available.
