    ● Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why.
  </h1>
  <p>
    I’ve previously used “Onshape” which is a 3D design software. I particularly liked and still like the attention to detail and the tools available to create a perfect 3D structure. The work-area isn’t cluttered and every tool is easy to find. I especially liked the effective use of windows, icons, menus and pointers which were all easy to find, learn and use. As a young student in a new course in a relatively new field, I’ve found the use of “Onshape” generally enjoyable, easy to use. There are of course areas for improvement, and the functionality of some tools aren’t as obvious as others, as well as camera was difficult to manipulate at first, but all of these issues are subjective rather than objective, with time I’ve learnt to use “Onshape” to it’s full entirety, which I later used for multiple work assignments, outside and inside of highschool.

    ● Why is software design important?
  </h1>
  <p>
    For myself, I define “Software Design” as the effective distribution of a program or software for users as well as other programmers. For users, how well a software is designed depends on how easy it is to learn the functionality of the program to its entirety. I believe the use of windows, icons, menus and pointers is a good way of increasing the learnability and improving the software design of the program in question. However for other software developers, how well a software is designed depends on how easy it is to understand the algorithms of the program and how easy it is to modify. Use of comments, clean coding styles and effective variable names could help in improving the design of a software.

    ● Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process. 
  </h1>
<p>
  Within the requirements gathering stage, information is directly gathered from the stakeholders on what the program should do. It is arguably the most important stage in the entire software design process, since it sets out the success criteria for the whole project. Information from the stakeholders can either be collected via direct methods such as interviews, questionnaires or surveys, or indirect methods such as observation, literature searches or evaluating competing systems. It is important that the approach of requirements gathering is very detailed, in order for the software design team to completely understand the needs of the stakeholders. The reason it is arguably the most important stage of the software design process is because only through the requirements from stakeholders, can developers actually develop a necessary product. Inaccurate or vague requirements risk the developers creating a solution to a problem that the stakeholders didn’t have, which in a competitive corporate scenario can result in the waste of vital resources and time. Furthermore, the original problem remains an issue.

  <h1>
    ● Write a short paragraph (up to 300 words) on the importance of communication in software design. Highlight its significance in the development process and briefly describe at least three key elements of effective communication. Share a personal experience related to a communication issue you’ve encountered and reflect on how you could have handled it better given what you have learned in class
  </h1>
  <p1>
 <div></div>
  It can be argued that communication is one of the most essential aspects in software design. It is important for the stakeholders to give clear and measurable needs to the developers and for the developers to provide regular updates on the project to the stakeholders, creating a 2-way communication channel. If the stakeholders aren’t clear in their needs, the possibility of the developers creating a redundant and useless program for the stakeholders increases. If the developers don’t consult the stakeholders and don't provide regular updates, there is a possibility the project can skew from meeting the needs of stakeholders, once again creating a useless program for the stakeholders. Three key aspects of effective communication include but are not limited to;
    <div></div>
  - Concise communication, exchanging quick and clear information. (i.e. “Change the color of the background to blue”, not “I don’t like the background color”)
   <div></div>
  - Constructive feedback/criticism, emotionless feedback, with general project improvement in mind. (i.e. “The saving system would work more efficiently if we use a cloud server”, not “You’d have to be a moron not to use a cloud server!”)
   <div></div>
  - Lack of leading questions, allowing the questionee to fully express their opinions. (i.e. “How was your experience with the GUI?”, not “What did you like the most about the GUI?”)
   <div></div>
  My personal communication issue comes from a project I created for my math teacher. During the interview,  he asked for a formulated math question whenever he ran the program. However, after delivering a prototype, he didn’t like the ASCII formulation of the question, so he then asked for a LateX question formulation. Had I expanded on question formulation during the interview, I would’ve been able to use my resources more efficiently, finishing the project sooner. This was a result of not paying attention during the interview.

    ● Write a short paragraph (up to 300 words) on one of the design principles we discussed in class. Select and state one of the design principles that you want to work on for your assignment. Define the design principle in your own words and discuss its importance in the context of software design. Identify and describe two examples of where you noticed or encountered this principle (it can be in software or any other domain). Explain how the design principle was used or should have been used to enhance the user experience.
  </h1>
  <div></div>
  <p1>
    5. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
  <div></div>
    Written in my own words, I view this design principle as “Constant development which rarely varies”. I've chosen this design principle since I believe it is inevitable that sooner or later, a project will encounter an issue that was either a result of poor planning or just unprecedented. I believe that if not all then most projects will face a scenario where a lot of work must be done in a very short time span. It can be argued that with proper planning and time management, a project can stay on track without the need of sacrificing sleepless nights. However we’re all human at the end of the day. I’ve experienced this first-hand while working on the second design assignment, having to sometimes work very late into the night. It’s no secret and I think the rest of the group would agree that we had a lot of work to do on the design assignment on the day of the deadline. I’ve also experienced this frequently in high school, most of the time right before a large project of which I wasn’t aware of the scale of. Of Course I think that these scenarios can be avoided in hindsight, however unexpected events can pop out of nowhere and thus delay a project from its deadline. And since unexpected things can happen to anyone, it can also happen to people working on a software project for example, which is exactly the reason I believe that a delay or postponing of a project is inevitable. I also believe that an unrealistic development pace, such as an extremely quick one, will only result in shortcuts, then errors, then failure of the entire project. Which once again reinforces the importance of this design principle.
