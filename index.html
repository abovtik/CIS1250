    ● Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why.
  </h1>
  <p>
    I’ve previously used “Onshape” which is a 3D design software. I particularly liked and still like the attention to detail and the tools available to create a perfect 3D structure. The work-area isn’t cluttered and every tool is easy to find. I especially liked the effective use of windows, icons, menus and pointers which were all easy to find, learn and use. As a young student in a new course in a relatively new field, I’ve found the use of “Onshape” generally enjoyable, easy to use. There are of course areas for improvement, and the functionality of some tools aren’t as obvious as others, as well as camera was difficult to manipulate at first, but all of these issues are subjective rather than objective, with time I’ve learnt to use “Onshape” to it’s full entirety, which I later used for multiple work assignments, outside and inside of highschool.

    ● Why is software design important?
  </h1>
  <p>
    For myself, I define “Software Design” as the effective distribution of a program or software for users as well as other programmers. For users, how well a software is designed depends on how easy it is to learn the functionality of the program to its entirety. I believe the use of windows, icons, menus and pointers is a good way of increasing the learnability and improving the software design of the program in question. However for other software developers, how well a software is designed depends on how easy it is to understand the algorithms of the program and how easy it is to modify. Use of comments, clean coding styles and effective variable names could help in improving the design of a software.

    ● Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process. 
  </h1>
<p>
  Within the requirements gathering stage, information is directly gathered from the stakeholders on what the program should do. It is arguably the most important stage in the entire software design process, since it sets out the success criteria for the whole project. Information from the stakeholders can either be collected via direct methods such as interviews, questionnaires or surveys, or indirect methods such as observation, literature searches or evaluating competing systems. It is important that the approach of requirements gathering is very detailed, in order for the software design team to completely understand the needs of the stakeholders. The reason it is arguably the most important stage of the software design process is because only through the requirements from stakeholders, can developers actually develop a necessary product. Inaccurate or vague requirements risk the developers creating a solution to a problem that the stakeholders didn’t have, which in a competitive corporate scenario can result in the waste of vital resources and time. Furthermore, the original problem remains an issue.

      ● Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in Writing Assignment 1 (Note: In Writing Assignment 1 you were asked to give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why). Write 5 user stories for that software. (Recall the user story template: As a (user type), I want (some action/function), so that (some reason) )?

  1. As a 3D modeler, I want a sketch feature, so that I can create objects on a 2D plane.
  <div></div>
  2. As a 3D modeler, I want an extrude feature, so that I can create objects in a 3D space from the 2D planes.
  <div></div>
  3. As a 3D modeler, I want a precision tool, so that I can enter numbers into length variables, providing an accurate and precise model.
  <div></div>
  4. As a 3D modeler, I want an import/export feature, which would allow me to import or export modeling files between different systems.
  <div></div>
  5. As a 3D modeler, I want a texturing feature, which would allow me to texture different faces of my model from a given set of textures.

    Experience: 10 years in the automotive industry.<div></div>
  <div></div>
    General Information:<div></div>
    Lewis lives alone in the southern part of London. Having landed a stable job at Ford, he designs and proposes new car designs depending on whatever his higher ups tell him. Whether it's fuel efficiency, aerodynamic stabilisation, or comfort, Lewis can design it all. He lives by the quote; "If you want something done right, do it yourself".<div></div>
  <div></div>
    Dimensions:<div></div>
    - Lewis is very methodical when it comes to design. He can spend hours on end, fixing one part of a design just for a small improvement in speed.<div></div>
    - Lewis has big aspirations. He hopes to open a local car shop of his own one day.<div></div>
    - Lewis is determined and serious in what he does, he won't quit anytime soon.<div></div>
  <div></div>
    Motivations:<div></div>
    - His status. Lewis feels as if his job represents him. When he looks in the mirror, hes proud to see a well-established engineer.<div></div>
    - His relationships. Lewis doesn't want to work at a completely different company just because of higher pay. He often misses his friends.<div></div>
    - His curiosity. He sometimes wonders to himself; "What if?". His curiosity drives and empowers him.<div></div>
