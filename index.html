    ● Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process. 
  </h1>
<p>
  Within the requirements gathering stage, information is directly gathered from the stakeholders on what the program should do. It is arguably the most important stage in the entire software design process, since it sets out the success criteria for the whole project. Information from the stakeholders can either be collected via direct methods such as interviews, questionnaires or surveys, or indirect methods such as observation, literature searches or evaluating competing systems. It is important that the approach of requirements gathering is very detailed, in order for the software design team to completely understand the needs of the stakeholders. The reason it is arguably the most important stage of the software design process is because only through the requirements from stakeholders, can developers actually develop a necessary product. Inaccurate or vague requirements risk the developers creating a solution to a problem that the stakeholders didn’t have, which in a competitive corporate scenario can result in the waste of vital resources and time. Furthermore, the original problem remains an issue.

      ● Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in Writing Assignment 1 (Note: In Writing Assignment 1 you were asked to give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why). Write 5 user stories for that software. (Recall the user story template: As a (user type), I want (some action/function), so that (some reason) )?

  1. As a 3D modeler, I want a sketch feature, so that I can create objects on a 2D plane.
  </p1>
  <p1>
  2. As a 3D modeler, I want an extrude feature, so that I can create objects in a 3D space from the 2D planes.
  </p1>
  <p1>
  3. As a 3D modeler, I want a precision tool, so that I can enter numbers into length variables, providing an accurate and precise model.
  </p1>
  <p1>
  4. As a 3D modeler, I want an import/export feature, which would allow me to import or export modeling files between different systems.
  </p1>
  <p1>
  5. As a 3D modeler, I want a texturing feature, which would allow me to texture different faces of my model from a given set of textures.
